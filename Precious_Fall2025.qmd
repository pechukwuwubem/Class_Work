Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: π * r^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

![Epichloë–grass–livestock triad](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anyadoc/hostfile/main/EpiTriad.png)

The image illustrates the ecological triad among *Epichloë* endophytes, cool‑season forage grasses (such as tall fescue/ryegrass), and mammals that interact with these plants. 
Endophyte-derived alkaloids can deter insect herbivores and influence plant fitness, but some compounds contribute to livestock toxicoses. 
This simple diagram helps frame host–microbe–consumer interactions that motivate genomic and metabolomic analyses in disease ecology and plant pathology.


### Sample Size Table
![Sample Size Table](https://github.com/anyadoc/audiseco/blob/main/ss_table.png)

# Question 1: Sample size for 5% prevalence, 95% confidence, N = 5000
N <- 5000
confidence <- 0.95
p <- 0.05
D <- p * N  # Number of diseased deer
n <- ceiling((log(1 - confidence) / log(1 - p)) * (N - (D / 2)) / N)
cat("Sample size needed:", n, "\n")

# Question 2: Compare sample sizes for large populations
# Scenario a: 95% confidence, 1% prevalence
confidence_a <- 0.95
p_a <- 0.01
n_a <- ceiling(log(1 - confidence_a) / log(1 - p_a))
cat("Sample size for 95% confidence, 1% prevalence:", n_a, "\n")

# Scenario b: 99% confidence, 2% prevalence
confidence_b <- 0.99
p_b <- 0.02
n_b <- ceiling(log(1 - confidence_b) / log(1 - p_b))
cat("Sample size for 99% confidence, 2% prevalence:", n_b, "\n")

# Question 3: Prevalence upper bound using Rule of Three
n <- 300
p_upper <- 3 / n * 100  # Convert to percentage
cat("95% confidence that prevalence is less than or equal to", p_upper, "%\n")
