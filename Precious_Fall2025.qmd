# Worksheet 2: Sample size for disease detection

**Instructions:** I inserted the sample size table (linked) and answered questions 1–3 below using the sample size table and the Rule of 3 as requested. Do not change the filename when you upload this back to GitHub.

![Sample size table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anyadoc/audiseco/main/ss_table.png)

### Q1
**Question:** Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

**Answer and work:** Using the sample size table for detection (95% confidence): at **5% prevalence**, the table lists a required sample size of **59** animals.  
**Final answer:** **59 deer**.

---

### Q2
**Question:** Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

b) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

**Answer and work:** Using the sample size table / hypergeometric approximations for large populations:

- (a) **95% confidence, 1% prevalence:** required sample size ≈ **299** animals.
- (b) **99% confidence, 2% prevalence:** required sample size ≈ **264** animals.

**Notes:** These values come from the lookup table used in class (ss_table.png). For very large populations the hypergeometric distribution approximates the binomial, and the table provides these common detection-sample-size values.

---

### Q3
**Question:** You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is _____ (<, =, >) ____%.

**Answer and work:** Apply the Rule of 3: when zero positives are observed in a sample of size *n*, the 95% upper confidence limit for prevalence ≈ 3/n. With *n = 300*:

3 / 300 = 0.01 = **1%**.

Therefore you are 95% confident that the prevalence is **< 1%**.

**Final answer:** **< 1%** (95% upper confidence limit = 1%).

# Worksheet 3: Measures of Disease Frequency — Prevalence and Incidence

### a) Daily Incidence
(From the table; first day they show RE or OD.)

06/10/25: 1889B → first affected 06/10

06/11/25: 2355B, 2565B, 5666B, 5971B → first affected 06/11 (4 elk)

06/12/25: 2320B, 2763B, 2772B, 4597B, 6001B → first affected 06/12 (5 elk)

06/13/25: 1322B, 4533B → first affected 06/13 (2 elk)

06/14/25: 1766B, 4599B → first affected 06/14 (2 elk)

No elk first became affected on 06/15/25 or 06/16/25.

A. 06/12/25

New cases on 06/12 = 5 (2320B, 2763B, 2772B, 4597B, 6001B).

Cases that had already first occurred before 06/12 (i.e., on 06/10 or 06/11) = 5 (1889B + 4 from 06/11).

Population at risk at start of 06/12 = 55 − 4 = 51.

Incidence (06/12) = 5/51=0.0980. 5/51=0.0980 = 0.098 cases per elk-day.

B. 06/14/25

New cases on 06/14 = 2 (1766B, 4599B).

Population at risk at start of 06/14 = 51 − 5 = 46.

Incedence = 2/44 =0.045 cases per elk-day

C. 06/15/25

New cases on 06/15 = 0 (no first occurrences on 06/15).

Incedence = 0/42 = 0.000 cases per elk-day


### b) Prevalence

**Prevalence** is the number of elk with conjunctivitis (showing RE or OD) divided by the total herd size (56).

- **06/13/25**:
  - Affected elk: 12 (2320B, 2355B, 2565B, 2763B, 2772B, 1889B, 1322B, 4533B, 4597B, 5666B, 5971B, 6001B).
  - Prevalence = 12 / 56 = 0.214 (or 21.4%).

- **06/16/25**:
  - Affected elk: 5 (2320B, 1766B, 1322B, 4533B, 4599B).
  - Prevalence = 5 / 56 = 0.089 (or 8.9%).
  
  **Unit for prevalence**: Proportion (dimensionless, often expressed as a percentage).

## c) Day When Prevalence Equals Incidence (Numerically, Ignoring Units)
**Prevalence** is the number of elk with conjunctivitis (RE or OD) divided by 56. **Incidence** is the number of new cases divided by susceptible elk (not infected or immune). We compare their numerical values:

- **06/10/25**: Prevalence = 1 / 56 = 0.0179, Incidence = 1 / 56 = 0.0179. Equal.
The day when prevalence equals incidence numerically is **06/10/25**.

### d) Day with Lowest Incidence
- **06/16/25**

### Submit a paragraph write-up on the basics of tick identification methods and the public health significance of ticks.

**Tick Identification**
Ticks are blood-feeding ectoparasites that infest humans, livestock, and wildlife, making their identification and control crucial in both veterinary and public health contexts. Tick identification
generally depends on morphological and molecular techniques. Morphological identification involves analyzing external features like mouthparts, scutum patterns, festoons, and leg segmentation with a stereomicroscope and standard taxonomic keys to differentiate between genera (such as Ixodes, Amblyomma, Rhipicephalus) and developmental stages or patterns, such as a white dot on the female lone star tick or ornate designs on the American dog tick. Molecular techniques, including PCR and DNA barcoding of mitochondrial genes (such as cox1 or 16S rRNA), enable accurate species identification, particularly when morphological features are unclear or damaged. Ticks are significant in public health because they carry various zoonotic pathogens, such as Borrelia burgdorferi (which causes Lyme disease), Rickettsia rickettsii (responsible for Rocky Mountain spotted fever), Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. Their capacity to transmit multiple pathogens and their range expansion driven by climate and ecological changes make accurate tick identification crucial for surveillance, diagnosis, and control efforts to reduce tick-borne disease risks.

## Exam Redo for 3 questions

## Question: In 2015, a mass die-off of Saiga antelope occurred in Kazakhstan, resulting in the deaths of over 200,000 animals within a short period. Briefly describe the proximate cause of this extraordinary mortality event and explain how it led to such large-scale deaths. What measures could be implemented to prevent similar mortality events in the future? Finally, discuss broader conservation strategies that could help safeguard Saiga antelopes from extinction due to disease outbreaks.

**Answer** : The proximate cause of the 2015 Saiga antelope mass die-off in Kazakhstan was hemorrhagic septicemia triggered by the bacterium Pasteurella multocida type B. This opportunistic pathogen, which typically lives harmlessly in the antelopes' tonsils as a commensal bacterium, became virulent due to unusual environmental conditions—specifically, abnormally high humidity and temperatures in the weeks leading up to the event. These weather anomalies likely stressed the animals and altered their nasal microbiomes, allowing the bacteria to proliferate rapidly and invade the bloodstream, causing acute septicemia that killed individuals within hours. The die-off coincided with the calving season, when large aggregations of females and newborns gathered in central Kazakhstan's steppe grasslands, facilitating explosive transmission through close contact and shared environments. This combination resulted in over 200,000 deaths—more than half the global population at the time—across multiple herds within just three weeks. 

To prevent similar mortality events in the future, several targeted measures could be implemented, focusing on early detection, risk mitigation, and resilience building. These include establishing real-time weather and health monitoring systems to identify high-risk conditions (e.g., elevated humidity and temperature) during calving seasons, allowing for potential interventions like temporary herd dispersal if feasible. Reducing interactions between Saiga and domestic livestock through zoning or fencing could minimize cross-species pathogen spillover, as livestock may harbor related bacteria. Research into vaccines against Pasteurella multocida for wildlife could be pursued, though challenges exist due to the bacterium's commensal nature. Additionally, building larger, more robust populations through overall conservation efforts would enhance genetic diversity and demographic resilience, enabling herds to better withstand periodic die-offs.

Broader conservation strategies to safeguard Saiga antelopes from extinction due to disease outbreaks should integrate disease management with holistic ecosystem protection. Key approaches include expanding and strengthening protected area networks to cover more of the Saiga's migratory range, reducing habitat fragmentation from infrastructure like roads and railways that could stress populations or facilitate disease spread. Anti-poaching enforcement through ranger patrols, community-based monitoring, and international trade regulations (e.g., under CITES) remains critical, as poaching for horns has historically decimated populations, leaving them more vulnerable to disease. Engaging local communities in conservation via education, alternative livelihoods, and benefit-sharing programs can foster stewardship and reduce human-wildlife conflicts. Long-term strategies should incorporate climate change adaptation, such as modeling future weather patterns to predict disease risks, and promoting international cooperation through frameworks like the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) to coordinate across range states including Kazakhstan, Russia, Uzbekistan, and Mongolia. Population monitoring via satellite tracking and genetic studies would further support adaptive management, aiming for sustainable growth to millions of individuals as seen in initiatives like the Altyn Dala Conservation Initiative.

## Question: Define Ro. Estimate Ro for the following scenario. Red flamingo represents an infectious case, and blue are susceptibles; an arrow indicates transmission. Explain your findings in the context of real-world utility of Ro.

**Answer** : R₀ (pronounced "R naught" or "R zero") is the basic reproduction number in epidemiology. It represents the average number of secondary infections caused by a single infectious individual in a population where everyone else is susceptible (i.e., no immunity or interventions). It assumes ideal conditions for transmission, such as no prior exposure or control measures. If R₀ > 1, the disease can spread and potentially lead to an epidemic; if R₀ < 1, the outbreak tends to die out; if R₀ = 1, the disease persists at a constant level.

Estimation of R₀ for the Scenario
The image depicts four separate transmission scenarios (panels separated by dashed lines), each starting with a red flamingo as the initial infectious case. Arrows indicate direct transmissions to blue flamingos (susceptibles who become infected). To estimate R₀, we calculate the average number of direct secondary infections per initial infectious case across the panels, as this samples the offspring distribution in a susceptible population.

Panel 1: The red flamingo has 1 arrow to 1 blue flamingo → 1 secondary infection.
Panel 2: The red flamingo has 3 arrows to 3 blue flamingos → 3 secondary infections.
Panel 3: The red flamingo has 2 arrows directly to 2 blue flamingos (one horizontal to the top-right blue, one diagonal down to the bottom-left blue). The additional arrow from the bottom-left blue to the bottom-right blue represents a tertiary infection (from a secondary case), which is not counted as a direct secondary from the initial red. → 2 secondary infections.
Panel 4: The red flamingo has no arrows → 0 secondary infections.

The number of secondary infections per initial case: 1, 3, 2, 0.
R₀ estimate = (1 + 3 + 2 + 0) / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5.
This is arrived at by summing the direct secondary cases across all initial infectors and dividing by the number of initial cases, providing a sample mean of the reproduction number under the assumption of a fully susceptible population.

Explanation in the Context of Real-World Utility of R₀
An estimated R₀ of 1.5 suggests the disease has moderate transmissibility and could sustain spread in a susceptible population, as each case generates more than one new case on average. In real-world scenarios, R₀ is a foundational metric for public health decision-making. For instance, it helps predict epidemic potential—diseases like measles (R₀ ≈ 12–18) require high vaccination rates for control, while something like seasonal influenza (R₀ ≈ 1.3) might need less aggressive interventions. The herd immunity threshold is calculated as 1 – 1/R₀; here, it would be 1 – 1/1.5 ≈ 33%, meaning at least 33% of the population needs immunity to prevent widespread transmission.
R₀ guides resource allocation, such as stockpiling vaccines or planning quarantine measures, and informs models for forecasting outbreak trajectories. However, real-world utility has limitations: R₀ is an average and doesn't account for population heterogeneity (e.g., superspreaders, as hinted by the variability in the panels from 0 to 3), behavioral changes, or interventions, which lower the effective reproduction number (R_e). Estimates like this one from small samples can be uncertain, so in practice, R₀ is refined using larger datasets, growth rates, or genomic sequencing for more accurate policy-making, as seen in responses to COVID-19 (initial R₀ ≈ 2–3).

## Question: Steve studies a population of the Suwannee Alligator Snapping turtle (Macrochelys suwanniensis) in Florida. He has been conducting a mark-recapture study of this population since 2010. Since 2015, he has documented cases of cutaneous fibroma in this population. The following data was collected by Steve:

## Worksheet 4: Multihost Pathogens, Spillover ##

## MERS-CoV
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is mostly found in camels (dromedaries), and direct physical contact with camels can lead to transmission to humans. Limited human-to-human transmission can occur after close contact and has resulted in health care–associated outbreaks. Human MERS-CoV infection can cause severe respiratory illness; approximately 35% of reported MERS cases have died. Distribution of confirmed cases of MERS by place of infection and month of onset, April 2012 – September 2025 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control). Which of the following statements about MERS-CoV are correct? (If it is incorrect, provide an explanation why the statement is incorrect.)

## Question 1: 1.	MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations. (2 points) ##

**Answer**: **Incorrect.** MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in dromedary camels; human cases are spill-over events from the animal reservoir, not sustained human-to-human transmission. Humans are usually infected through direct or indirect contact with infected camels or their secretions.


##Question 2: 2.	Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV. (2 points)

**Answers**: Correct
Explanation: Dromedary camels are the natural reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV. The virus circulates in camel populations, and humans are usually infected through direct or indirect contact with infected camels or their secretions.

##Question 3: 3.	Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV. (2 points)

**Answer**: Correct
Explanation: Human-to-human transmission can occur (especially in healthcare settings), but it is limited and unsustained. The virus does not establish long-term transmission chains in humans, so humans are considered dead-end hosts.

##Question 4: 4.	The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%. (2 points)
Incorrect
Explanation: The case fatality rate is about 35%, not 65%. Roughly one-third of reported MERS cases result in death, according to WHO and ECDC data.

##Question 5: The epidemic curve indicates this is a point source outbreak. (2 points)

**Answers**: Incorrect
Explanation: The epidemic curve shows multiple peaks over several years (2012–2025), which is consistent with sporadic and healthcare-associated outbreaks, not a single point source. Point source outbreaks typically show one sharp peak over a short period.


##Oct 27, 2025 

## Worksheet 5: Community Epidemiology Framework

**Marburg Virus Outbreak, Rwanda 2024**
The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda
probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit
bats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases of
Marburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were health
care workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units.

**Question 1** : Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen, would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging

**Answers** : Classification: Spillover Event or Emerging Infectious Disease (5 points)
Using Fenton and Pedersen’s community epidemiology framework, this Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda would be classified primarily as a spillover event, although it shows early characteristics of an emerging infectious disease.

Justification:

Spillover event:
The index (first) case was infected after exposure to a natural wildlife reservoir—Egyptian rousette bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus)—inside a cave. This direct transmission from a wildlife host to a human represents a zoonotic spillover, where the pathogen crosses the species barrier under ecological circumstances.

Emerging infectious disease potential:
Following the initial spillover, the virus spread human-to-human, especially among healthcare workers, indicating secondary transmission chains within human populations. This transition reflects an emergent phase where ecological, behavioral, and healthcare factors enable sustained transmission.

Framework context (Fenton & Pedersen):
Their model emphasizes how pathogen dynamics arise from the interaction between reservoir hosts, humans, and environmental conditions. Here, the cave environment (reservoir interface) and healthcare transmission (community amplification) align with a spillover origin that may evolve into an emerging epidemic.

**Question 2** : What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings?

**Answers** : Measures to Reduce Transmission in Community and Healthcare Settings (5 points)

In the community:

Limit human–bat contact: Restrict or monitor access to bat-inhabited caves; install physical barriers and post warning signage.

Health education: Educate local populations about avoiding fruit contaminated by bats and safe burial practices.

Surveillance and early detection: Establish rapid reporting systems in at-risk areas to identify and isolate suspected cases promptly.

Safe cultural practices: Modify high-risk behaviors such as handling bushmeat or entering caves without protection.

In healthcare settings:

Infection prevention and control (IPC): Use full PPE (gowns, gloves, masks, face shields) for all suspected or confirmed cases.

Isolation and cohorting: Isolate infected patients in negative-pressure or dedicated wards to prevent nosocomial spread.

Training and awareness: Regularly train healthcare workers on proper donning/doffing of PPE and handling of infectious waste.

Strict biosafety protocols: Decontaminate instruments, waste, and surfaces; use safe injection and disposal practices.

Supportive care units: Designate specific facilities for viral hemorrhagic fevers to reduce risk to general ICUs.

#Worksheet 7: Nipah Virus, Langya Henipavirus & Avian Reovirus#

*Nipah Virus*
Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission
in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ
between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventive
measures recommended in each setting.

*Answers*
Nipah virus circulates within the same reservoir—fruit bats of the genus Pteropus—but the ecology and spillover pathways differ sharply between Malaysia and Bangladesh. These differences shape not only how outbreaks start but also the control strategies used in each region.

Malaysia: spillover via pigs as amplifying hosts
The 1998–1999 Malaysian outbreak was driven primarily by a bat–pig–human transmission chain. Bats fed on fruit trees planted near pig farms, contaminating pig enclosures with saliva, urine, or partially eaten fruit. Infected pigs developed respiratory signs and amplified the virus to high titers, enabling efficient pig-to-human spread among farmers and abattoir workers. Human-to-human transmission was minimal.

Implications for prevention in Malaysia:
Because livestock were the key bridge, prevention emphasized:

Separating fruit bats and pig farms (removal of fruit trees near enclosures, modifying farm layouts).

Surveillance and culling of infected pigs to break the amplification cycle.

Improved biosecurity and personal protective equipment for pig farmers and slaughterhouse workers.

Movement controls on pigs during outbreaks.
Overall, interventions targeted agricultural practices and animal husbandry rather than community-level human behaviors.

Bangladesh: direct bat-to-human and human-to-human transmission
In contrast, Bangladesh experiences repeated spillover events driven largely by direct exposure to bat-contaminated food—especially fresh date palm sap harvested overnight. Bats lick sap streams or urinate into collecting pots, seeding virus directly into a popular seasonal drink. Person-to-person transmission, often through close caregiving of symptomatic individuals, is much more common in Bangladesh than in Malaysia.

Implications for prevention in Bangladesh:
Control focuses on limiting direct exposure to contaminated products and reducing secondary spread:

Protecting date-palm sap collection pots with bamboo skirts or nets (“banjhi”) to prevent bat access.

Discouraging consumption of raw, unprocessed date palm sap during high-risk seasons.

Promoting safe caregiving practices and early isolation of suspected cases due to frequent human-to-human transmission.

*Avian Reovirus*
Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the
different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its
transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes?
Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe
its impact on the affected population. 

*Answers*
Avian reoviruses (ARV) spread efficiently in poultry and wild birds because they exploit several transmission pathways and are supported by environmental and viral traits that allow them to persist in harsh conditions.

Transmission Routes of ARV
1. Horizontal Transmission

a. Fecal–oral route
The most common pathway. Infected birds shed large quantities of virus in feces. Other birds become infected when they ingest contaminated feed, water, litter, or soil.

b. Respiratory route
Aerosolized viral particles or dust contaminated with feces and secretions can be inhaled, especially in crowded housing or roosts.

c. Direct contact
Bird-to-bird contact spreads the virus rapidly within flocks.

d. Fomite transmission
ARV survives on contaminated equipment, clothing, boots, cages, and transport crates, enabling mechanical movement between facilities.

2. Vertical Transmission

ARV can pass from infected hens to chicks via the egg. Embryos may become infected early in development, leading to weak chicks, early mortality, or birds that hatch already shedding virus.

Vertical transmission is particularly important because it introduces ARV into naïve flocks and sustains long-term circulation.

Environmental Factors That Favor ARV Transmission

High bird density (poultry houses, shared roosts): increases contact and fecal–oral cycling.

Poor ventilation and dust accumulation: enhances respiratory spread.

Moist, organic-rich litter: supports viral stability and promotes fecal contamination.

Low sanitation / inadequate disinfection: ARV is resistant to many disinfectants.

Cool temperatures: prolong viral survival in the environment.

Shared water sources in wild birds (ponds, wetlands): facilitate ingestion of contaminated material.

These factors create an environment where both horizontal and vertical transmission can flourish.

Pathogen Characteristics That Support a Transmission Route

A key characteristic enabling fecal–oral and fomite transmission is the virus’s non-enveloped, double-stranded RNA structure.

Non-enveloped viruses are inherently more resistant to:

detergents

desiccation

temperature fluctuations

many disinfectants

This environmental durability allows ARV to remain infectious for long periods on litter, soil, carriers’ boots, and equipment—making fecal–oral and fomite routes highly effective.

Example of a Wild Bird Disease Caused by ARV
ARV-Associated Viral Arthritis/Tenosynovitis in Wild Turkeys

Wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) have experienced outbreaks of ARV-associated viral arthritis and tenosynovitis. Birds develop swollen hock joints, lameness, and reduced mobility.

Impact on populations:

Infected birds struggle to forage or escape predators.

Survival rates drop, especially in juveniles.

Affected flocks may experience reduced recruitment due to decreased mobility and increased predation.

In severe cases, localized population declines have been recorded, particularly where environmental stress (cold, nutritional stress) worsens disease outcomes.

*Langya henipavirus*
Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China.
Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV
classified as a spillover and not a potential EID?

*Answers*
Langya henipavirus (LayV) is a newly detected zoonotic paramyxovirus, but its ecology and epidemiology point to a very limited capacity for sustained human spread.

Reservoir and Transmission Route
Likely Reservoir

Evidence from field investigations in Shandong and Henan provinces shows very high LayV RNA detection rates in shrews (approximately 25% of sampled shrews).
This strongly suggests that shrews are the primary natural reservoir of Langya virus.

Transmission Route

Current data indicate:

Spillover from shrews to humans is the dominant pathway.

Most human cases had recent animal exposure, particularly contact with shrews or environments where shrews forage.

No confirmed human-to-human transmission has been observed; epidemiological investigations found no clustering among contacts or family members.

Thus, LayV appears to be transmitted zoonotically through direct or environmental exposure to infected shrews rather than through sustained human spread.

Why LayV Is Classified as a Spillover and Not a Potential Emerging Infectious Disease (EID)

LayV is considered a spillover virus rather than an emerging infectious disease threat because:

1. No evidence of human-to-human transmission

A defining characteristic of an EID is the ability to spread within human populations. LayV has shown only sporadic, isolated human infections without secondary spread, making it ecologically contained.

2. Low incidence and lack of outbreak patterns

Reported cases occur sporadically, scattered geographically, and without temporal clustering—typical of repeated spillover events, not an expanding epidemic.

3. Domesticated animals do not appear to be amplifying hosts

Although LayV antibodies have been detected in some livestock (e.g., goats, dogs), there is no sign of efficient transmission or amplification that could promote broader spread into humans.

4. Virus characteristics appear poorly adapted to humans

Current evidence implies limited receptor compatibility and replication efficiency in humans, meaning LayV lacks traits needed for epidemic potential, unlike Nipah virus or Hendra virus which show stronger human pathogenicity patterns.

•	In Central and Southern regions, all females were infected. Males had lower prevalence everywhere. Sex differences are strongest where overall environmental infection pressure is high.

CONCLUSION
Infection with B. procyonis varies widely, with the highest prevalence in Central and South Asia. Females are more likely to become infected, particularly in high-risk settings. Age differences exist, but are not statistically significant. Worm burdens are highly aggregated, making a few number of heavily infected raccoons the primary cause of ambient egg contamination. These patterns highlight important risk gradients for wildlife, domestic animals, and human exposure in endemic areas.

#Worksheet 9#

*In 2024, a multistate Salmonella outbreak was linked to backyard poultry flocks in the United States. What specific human behaviors contributed to the zoonotic spread of Salmonella? In your response, identify at least three practices by backyard poultry owners that increased the risk of Salmonella transmission, and briefly explain why these behaviors facilitated human infection*.

1. Handling birds without washing hands afterward

People frequently touched chickens, ducks, or their equipment and did not wash their hands, especially before eating or touching their face.
Why this spreads Salmonella: The bacteria are shed in poultry feces and easily contaminate feathers, feet, beaks, and coops. Without handwashing, the pathogen is transferred directly into the mouth.

2. Allowing poultry inside homes or close to human living spaces

Some owners let birds roam inside kitchens, living rooms, or children’s play areas.
Why this spreads Salmonella: Indoor contamination spreads the bacteria to surfaces, floors, and food-preparation areas, increasing environmental exposure and ingestion risk.

3. Kissing, cuddling, or closely snuggling poultry

Children and adults were reported to kiss, cuddle, or hold birds near their faces.
Why this spreads Salmonella: Close contact brings contaminated feathers and droppings to the mouth and nose, creating a direct route of transmission.

Additional risky behaviors often identified in outbreaks

Eating or drinking around poultry coops.

Letting children under five handle birds unsupervised.

Cleaning coops or waterers indoors (e.g., in kitchen sinks).


#2. Tall fescue grass is commonly infected with a fungal endophyte (Epichloë
coenophiala) that produces ergot alkaloids associated with fescue toxicosis in
grazing livestock.
a. What advantage does Tall fescue gain from being infected with a fungal
endophyte? 3 points
b. What environmental and ecological factors drive the occurrence and severity of
fescue toxicosis in grazing systems? 4 points
c. What are the key clinical signs of fescue toxicity in cattle? 3 points


a. Advantage to Tall Fescue (3 points)
Infection with Epichloë coenophiala enhances tall fescue’s stress tolerance and competitive ability. Key benefits include:


Improved drought tolerance – endophyte-infected plants maintain higher water-use efficiency and survive dry periods better.


Enhanced resistance to insects and herbivores – alkaloids produced by the endophyte deter pests, reducing defoliation.


Greater persistence and vigor – infected stands establish more strongly, outcompete weeds, and remain productive over years.



b. Environmental and Ecological Factors Influencing Fescue Toxicosis (4 points)
Several conditions intensify the risk and severity of toxicosis in grazing systems:


High endophyte infection rates in pastures – more infected plants produce more ergot alkaloids consumed by livestock.


Hot, humid summer weather – heat stress worsens vasoconstriction caused by alkaloids, amplifying clinical symptoms.


Poor forage diversity / overgrazing – when tall fescue dominates, animals ingest higher quantities of toxic endophyte-infected plants.


Plant stress conditions (drought, nutrient stress, late-season growth) – stress increases alkaloid concentrations in leaves and seeds.



c. Key Clinical Signs of Fescue Toxicity in Cattle (3 points)


Vasoconstriction leading to heat intolerance – rough hair coat, elevated body temperature, seeking shade or water.


Reduced performance – decreased feed intake, poor weight gain, reduced milk production.


Fescue foot and reproductive issues – lameness, sloughing of hooves or tail tips in cold weather; lowered fertility and longer gestation.


#Worksheet 10#

*What are the different routes of transmission for African Swine fever? What role do humans play in the spread and transmission of ASF? 10 points*

Routes of Transmission for African Swine Fever (ASF)

1. Direct contact with infected pigs
Healthy pigs become infected when they contact sick or carrier pigs shedding the virus in blood, saliva, feces, urine, or respiratory secretions.

2. Indirect transmission via contaminated fomites
The virus survives for long periods on equipment, vehicles, boots, clothing, needles, feed troughs, and bedding. Contact with these contaminated objects easily spreads ASF between farms.

3. Ingestion of contaminated pork products (swill feeding)
Feeding pigs uncooked or undercooked food waste containing infected pork remains one of the most efficient transmission routes.

4. Tick-borne transmission (soft ticks, Ornithodoros spp.)
These ticks act as biological vectors and reservoirs, enabling transmission between wild suids and sometimes domestic pigs.

5. Transmission through wild suids (wild boar and warthogs)
Wild populations maintain and spread the virus through their movements, carcasses, and interactions near domestic herds.

6. Environmental contamination
ASFV persists for weeks to months in soil, manure, and water sources, allowing exposure even without direct contact.

Role of Humans in the Spread and Transmission of ASF

7. Movement of infected pigs between farms or regions
Humans transport pigs for trade or production, creating rapid, long-distance spread.

8. Transport of contaminated pork products
Travelers carrying infected meat, illegal importation, and improper disposal of pork waste introduce the virus into new areas.

9. Poor biosecurity practices on farms
Failure to disinfect equipment, sharing tools between farms, inadequate quarantine of new pigs, and improper cleaning of transport trucks allow the virus to move easily.

10. Human-mediated mechanical transmission
Farm workers, visitors, and veterinarians can mechanically transfer the virus on their hands, boots, clothing, and equipment if hygiene protocols are not followed.

*Describe how co-infection with Koala retrovirus (KoRV) affects the severity, progression, and management of Chlamydia in koalas. 10 points*

How KoRV Co-Infection Affects Chlamydia in Koalas
1. Immunosuppression caused by KoRV

KoRV—especially KoRV-A and KoRV-B—targets immune cells and weakens koalas’ adaptive immunity. This reduces their ability to control Chlamydia pecorum or C. pneumoniae, allowing the bacteria to proliferate more aggressively.

2. Increased susceptibility to acquiring Chlamydia

Koalas infected with KoRV show higher rates of initial Chlamydia infection because their compromised immune system cannot mount an effective early inflammatory response.

3. More severe clinical disease

KoRV-positive koalas typically develop the most severe chlamydial pathologies, including:

Severe keratoconjunctivitis → blindness

Cystitis and urinary tract inflammation

Reproductive tract fibrosis → infertility

KoRV amplifies the inflammatory damage caused by Chlamydia.

4. Faster progression of Chlamydia disease

Co-infected animals transition more rapidly from mild to chronic or systemic disease, leading to earlier organ damage and decreased survival.

5. Reduced response to antibiotic treatment

KoRV-impaired immunity limits the effectiveness of standard antibiotics (e.g., doxycycline). Koalas may relapse or fail to fully clear the infection even after treatment.

6. Higher risk of secondary infections

Because KoRV reduces overall immune competence, co-infected koalas become vulnerable to other opportunistic infections that complicate Chlamydia treatment and recovery.

7. Increased mortality

The combination of KoRV-driven immunosuppression and severe Chlamydia pathology significantly raises the risk of death, especially in young or stressed koalas.

8. Management requires integrated viral and bacterial control

Wildlife veterinarians must consider KoRV status when making treatment decisions. KoRV-positive animals often require longer antibiotic courses, more intensive monitoring, and supportive care.

9. Implications for population management

KoRV presence in a population predicts higher Chlamydia prevalence and poorer reproductive output. This complicates conservation—populations with widespread KoRV deteriorate faster when Chlamydia is present.

10. Vaccine development and planning are affected

Chlamydia vaccine efforts in koalas must account for KoRV-mediated immune dysfunction. Vaccines may be less effective in KoRV-positive individuals, influencing how vaccination strategies are designed and deployed.


*Snake Fungal Disease (SFD), caused by Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola, is an emerging threat to wild snake populations in North America. What are the key challenges associated with the surveillance and management of Snake Fungal Disease (SFD)? 10 points*

Key Challenges in Surveillance and Management of Snake Fungal Disease (SFD)
1. Difficulty detecting snakes in the wild

Snakes are cryptic, elusive, and often underground or inactive for long periods. This makes population-level surveillance extremely difficult and reduces detection probability.

2. Limited diagnostic access and sampling opportunities

Handling wild snakes is labor-intensive and requires permits. Obtaining skin samples, swabs, or biopsies is difficult, and many snakes show subtle lesions that can be mistaken for other injuries or infections.

3. Lack of baseline data on snake populations

For most North American snake species, pre-SFD population data are scarce. Without baseline metrics, determining declines or SFD-driven mortality is challenging.

4. Variable clinical expression across species and individuals

Some species show severe lesions and die, while others carry the fungus with mild or no signs. This variability complicates surveillance and risk assessment.

5. Environmental persistence of the fungus

Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola can survive in soil and leaf litter for extended periods. Environmental reservoirs make eradication nearly impossible and allow repeated exposure.

6. Limited treatment options for free-ranging wildlife

Antifungal treatments are feasible only for captive or rehabilitated snakes—not for wild populations. Delivering treatment in the field at scale is not possible.

7. High stress and risk during capture and handling

Snakes are sensitive to handling stress, and repeated captures for monitoring may negatively impact their health or survival.

8. Insufficient funding and specialized expertise

SFD surveillance requires herpetologists, wildlife pathologists, and molecular diagnostics. Many regions lack funding, trained personnel, or laboratory capacity.

9. Ecological complexity and unknown transmission pathways

The roles of environment, seasonality, and snake behavior in transmission are only partially understood, making it difficult to design targeted management.

10. Slow regulatory response and conservation coordination

Because many snake species are not charismatic or commercially valuable, management policies are slower to develop, and cross-state coordination is inconsistent.
