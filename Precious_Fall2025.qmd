Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: π * r^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

The image illustrates the ecological triad among *Epichloë* endophytes, cool‑season forage grasses (such as tall fescue/ryegrass), and mammals that interact with these plants. 
Endophyte-derived alkaloids can deter insect herbivores and influence plant fitness, but some compounds contribute to livestock toxicoses. 
This simple diagram helps frame host–microbe–consumer interactions that motivate genomic and metabolomic analyses in disease ecology and plant pathology.
